1.  Consider the uses of a basket, as well as alternate light sources.
    Remember that the solution to a problem may not necessarily reside in
    the same room...or at the same height.


2.  First, get the spirits' attention. Having done that,  there's only two
    other things  left to do, so play around a little until you have
    everything in the right order. Read any  good books lately?


3.  This one is easy, if subtle. Consider the outstanding quality of the
    room, and make an order  of it.


4.  Well, you know where to look, right? You just have to do something
    first. Have you seen anything around that might remind you of a rainbow?
    Get the point?


5.  The program didn't lie: *YOU* have neither the skills nor the expertise,
    so who else is left? Be generous, it will pay off in the end.


6.  First, you need to have the egg open. Then, you have to go to  the
    logical place and do the logical thing. When the egg is open, this
    should be music to your ears.


7.  Everything you need is at hand. Play around in the Maintenance Room, and
    remember to check other rooms as well for a  change. Tools can come in
    handy, too.
